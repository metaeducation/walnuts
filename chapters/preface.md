# Preface to the 2014 Edition

I was one of a group of seven students from Lake Braddock Secondary School who created *Wally and the Walnuts*. The project was coordinated by 8th grade social studies teacher Tina Yalen, who wanted some of her recent graduates to update a manuscript she used called *How Our Economic System Works*. That piece was written by William G. Tapply at Tufts University, and published in 1969.

During weekly summer meetings, *Wally* took on a life of its own. Our pizza-fueled committee would have lively debates about just how silly an economics book could (or should) be. As it happened, I wound up doing the illustrations and all the writing that needed to be done between sessions. But the world-building and characters were the work of the group as a whole.

The first edition was published in 1991--with more printings in 1992, 1997, and 1998. At one point the book was in use across several Fairfax County schools...but fell out of distribution as it began to show its own age. Mrs. Yalen gave her blessing to putting it up on the web in 2002, but I didn't get around to the needed updates until digitizing my personal archives in 2014.

A lot has changed in the decades since the initial publication. Sadly, William Tapply passed away in 2009. I believe I speak for all the Wallyworkers in wanting to dedicate this work to him...for his inspiration and support. By releasing *Wally* under a Creative Commons license, hopefully there will be a new generation of Wallyworkers to develop these ideas even further.
