Everyone in the village felt the high spirit of the time, none more than Bianca and Marvin. While working in their bountiful fields, Bianca decided that her relationship with Marvin would be more fruitful if they would finally tie the knot.

Sweetly, she said to Marvin, "My little pumpkin, I know this is going to sound corny, but I feel the time is ripe for us to sow the seeds of our love and let our relationship blossom!"

Marvin, overjoyed by Bianca's proposal, gently placed a 24 carrot ring on her finger, exclaiming, "Lettuce be married!"[^corn]

The joy of the prosperous village was now complete as word of the wedding traveled through the village grapevine. Everyone was invited, and only Smidley refused to attend; and he missed one of the greatest social events in the history of the valley.

Marvin wore a suit made of the finest skins, while Bianca was ravishing in her exquisite corn silk gown. Barbie the bop and Tiffany the trendsetter, dressed to kill in their most outrageous outfits, flirted with all the Caplander guys, and showed off the newest dance craze, the Walnut Wiggle. They danced until dawn to fine music provided by Denny the DJ.

As the Caplanders showered the couple with good wishes, Bianca hurled her beautiful and delicate bouquet of produce high into the air. At once, all of the single women lunged after it. A smiling but rumpled Wendy emerged from the heap victorious, waving the bouquet and batting her eyelashes at Wally.

The celebration came to a close, and contentment filled the air. Exhausted but happy, the newlyweds decided to travel the valley for a few weeks leaving their assistant, Gordo the Gardener, to tend to the fields.
