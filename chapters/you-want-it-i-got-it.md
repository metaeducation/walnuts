![Coats for Sale in Sweltering Heat](images/illustrations/sweltering-coat-sale.pdf)

With the new monetary system established, and with a standard of value, there was no need for barter anymore. People did not have to worry about trying to trade ducks and shoes and hut repairs for each other. They simply had to worry about trading wood pieces for goods, at a set **price**.

Wally based his prices on a system that he discovered almost by accident. One sweltering summer day, Cathy the coatmaker walked into Wallyworth's with a large supply of coats. Wally wiped the sweat from his brow and loosened the collar of his green polyester suit[^polyester].

"Wally, I have come to sell you my supply of fur coats," said Cathy. "I need ten wood pieces each for them."

He gave her a quizzical look. "Are you kidding? Who would buy coats on a day like today?"

"Oh please, Wally!" begged Cathy, "My husband left me with my fourteen children, who are all sick and starving at home! I need wood pieces now!"

Wally was sympathetic, but knew he could not sell the coats in this weather. Then it clicked: if he bought the coats at a reduced price when **demand** is low, he could store store them until winter when demand was high. Then he could sell them at a much higher price, creating more profit!

"I'll tell you what, I'll give you five wood pieces per coat," offered Wally.

Cathy was offended and disappointed at his counter offer.

"I've worked hard on these coats!" she said angrily. "I could easily sell them for fifteen wood pieces this winter!"

"But didn't you need the money now?" said Wally suspiciously. "What about your children?"

Cathy grumbled and took the money, and Wally put the coats in storage.

This **supply and demand** relationship also held true in his transactions with Marvin and Bianca. For example, if the tomato season was bad, Wally would be willing to give many wood pieces to Marvin and Bianca for only a few of the tomatoes. However, if the tomato crop was larger, Wally would give them fewer wood pieces for the same number of tomatoes.

From this point on, supply and demand was what determined the prices in Wallyworth's. If there was not a very high demand for a particular product, prices dropped and the producer risked losses. On the other hand, if there was a great demand for a product that was available in only limited quantities, prices would climb and profits would rise. The villagers also discovered that besides affecting their **purchase** costs, it also affected their wages.

Due to the high demand for products in the village, numerous employers hired some of the younger villagers to work in their shops and factories. Some of the workers performed difficult tasks such as stitching shirts or painting pottery. Others had jobs that were extremely dangerous, such as digging coal in deep mines in the side of the mountain. Some had jobs that required no skill at all, such as carrying logs from the forest or digging holes for fence posts.

In general, villagers were paid according to the difficulty or danger of their jobs. Those jobs that were easy could be performed by almost anyone. Since the supply of such **unskilled workers** was large, it was not necessary to pay much to get them. On the other hand, a much smaller supply of **skilled workers** existed who could perform the difficult task, so the value of their services was considerably higher. Since there were not that many people who were willing to work in the coal mines, those who did were well paid.

So the **law of supply and demand** determined the pay workers would receive, just as it determined the value of goods on the market.
