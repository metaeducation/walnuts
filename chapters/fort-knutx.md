An emergency town meeting was called to decide what to do about the catastrophe.

"I say we throw Wally in jail!" one man named Rick rashly exclaimed. "This whole thing is his fault. If he hadn't given out those worthless pieces of wood, this never would have happened."

"What good would that do?" asked Ramona, who was widely known for being reasonable. "It wouldn't solve the problem. Besides, I think that it is our fault because we didn't prevent the situation from happening in the first place."

"I agree," said Ron, who was one of the most respected villagers in the valley. "Wally did what he thought was best; we can't blame him. Now it is up to us to do something. We need to restore faith in the currency, and I say we cannot have an individual in charge. It is too important and it affects the whole village."

The villagers murmured agreement. Bianca offered a suggestion.

"This does sound like something that should be handled by more than one person," she said. "But we can't keep calling town meetings and holding votes every time a decision that affects everyone needs to be made. What if we voted for people who then voted on our behalf? Marvin and I usually agree with whatever Ron says, so he could represent us."

Marvin shuffled his feet nervously. "Actually dear, I actually think Rick might have a point this time..."

Bianca's glare at Marvin indicated there was going to be a discussion back at the garden. But it was decided that a few of the villagers would be chosen to establish some rules. These people made up the legislature of the village, and whenever a new idea or policy was proposed, they would decide whether or not it should become a law, depending on whether they believed it reflected the wishes of the people. Since they represented the villagers in this way, these people were called **representatives**.

Ron, Ramona, Rebecca, and Rick were among those chosen to be representatives. It was now their responsibility to restore faith in the currency. They began to closely examine the problem that faced them. Several ideas were discussed.

"Let's pass a law that says everyone has to use the pieces of wood as currency," suggested Rick, "and throw all the people who don't accept it in jail!"

"I think that we should make the currency ourselves instead," said Ron. "If we are going to get people's confidence, then we are going to need to convince them that things have changed, and the same thing can't happen again."

This idea was greeted with much enthusiasm. An innovative representative named Dolores--known for her prior career in making colorful dresses--built on Ron's idea.

"Our money could be different from Wally's, maybe print it on cloth and dye it green," she suggested. "People will have faith in the money if the government makes it. As long as this faith exists, this kind of thing will never happen again."

A vote was taken, and it was decided that the government would begin making the currency of the village, and would call it the dollar. People could exchange their walnuts for the new cloth money.  Although Wally could still operate his store, heï¿¼would no longer **manufacture** the currency...and the government's store of walnuts was protected at a heavily guarded grove known as Fort Knutz.

It did not seem necessary to store a bucket of walnuts for every cloth dollar in circulation. But the government realized that for a while, it would have to strictly control the **ratio** between buckets of walnuts and dollars. The important thing would be to maintain the value of the dollar and the faith in the government, since only then would the people have faith in the money.

The decision was announced to the villagers, who felt they could trust the new money if the government was in charge. Soon, the walnuts had been exchanged for the new dollars, and they were circulating freely. Wallyworth's reopened, as did other shops throughout Capland. Transactions also resumed at Bart's Bank. The economy grew, and Wally once again was profiting.

Before long, prosperity again reigned in the valley. The new government was called on to do many more things for the village, and in order to accomplish them they needed money. Since everyone benefited from government services, it was felt that each villager should contribute to the running of their government.

One of the two ways the government could raise **revenue** was by **taxing** families according to their incomes and **assets**. The second way was to borrow money from the people. A villager might lend the government some number of dollars. In return, he or she would receive a **receipt** from the government promising to repay the loan with interest after five or ten years.

The government was prompt in repaying its loans on request, and the cause was a good one, so lending money to the government became a popular way of investing. The IOU's or promises from the government became known as **bonds**.
