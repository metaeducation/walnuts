The villagers no longer had to do everything for themselves, and it was easy to find the person who had the goods or services that they wanted. But finding them wasn't enough--sometimes the specialist didn't need what you made to offer! Frequently, people had to go through numerous **transactions** before they ended up with what they were looking for.

One such example was when Sean needed a new hammer. He approached Tony, the toolmaker, and asked if he would be willing to trade a hammer for a new pair of shoes. Unfortunately, what Tony wanted was a high **quality** shirt. When Sean went to see Shirley, she did not accept the shoes but told him that she needed two heads of lettuce.

"This could go on forever," muttered Sean. He was so frustrated he decided the hammer could wait!

Dealing with each **product** and service's **value** also created problems. When Harvey and Harry came back from hunting, they were uncertain as to how many carrots they should charge Marvin and Bianca for a duck, as compared to the number of shirts Shirley could give them for the same duck. Plus, there was no way Shirley could offer "half a shirt" to trade. It was very confusing.

Most of the villagers wanted to get down to making shoes or repairing huts, and they considered negotiation to be a hassle...especially if they had to deal with several people to get the one thing they wanted. Yet strangely, Wally seemed to be trading his walnuts for things he didn't need on purpose, just so he could try and find someone else to trade with again.

"I don't believe it!" exclaimed Marvin to Bianca. "We've got our hands full bartering vegetables all day, because otherwise they'll rot on the vine. Wally's walnuts last for years...so he could wait however long he wanted, but he spends all day trading."

Bianca nodded in amazement.

"Something else I heard," she gossiped, "is that most of the time he just trades it all back for walnuts again. He treats it like a game, where he tries to get more than he started out with!!! Wally is nuts!"

"Wait a second," mused Marvin. "Since Wally likes this game so much, why don't we just take all our vegetables to him and get walnuts? They'd last much longer than our vegetables do, and we could focus on farming and spend less time trading!"

Wally was eager to strike a deal, so Marvin and Bianca swapped their entire harvest for buckets upon buckets of walnuts. They took a few of them to Herb, who they'd been wanting to talk to about building a shed to store their gardening tools in. Herb waved as they walked up, but shook his head.

"I know they're good for me, but I still don't like vegetables!" he said, stepping down from his ladder. "What I could really use right now are some new shirts! So you'll need to go talk to Shirley first."

Marvin and Bianca showed him that their buckets contained walnuts, not vegetables.

"Well, I don't really want walnuts either," remarked Herb. "Today, I could use a shirt. Tomorrow...who knows?"

"Come on Herb," pleaded Marvin, "you know Wally, he's always got tons of stuff he's picked up that he's trying to trade back for walnuts again. If he finds out you have walnuts and you want a shirt, he'll find a way to get that shirt to you."

"And if you change your mind and decide you want something else, Wally will find that too!" chimed Bianca.

"I guess you're right," said Herb, scratching his head. "You pretty much can't go wrong with walnuts! If worst comes to worst, I can just eat them."

It wasn't long before Marvin and Bianca decided to trade their crops for walnuts every time they had a harvest. It made it fairly easy for them, but now if the villagers wanted fruit and vegetables they would have to do their bartering with Wally, since he was the only one who distributed them.

Eventually everyone adopted this strategy. Shirley would go to Wally on the first day of each month and give him all the shirts she had made in return for several bushels of walnuts. Harvey and Harry would take the ducks they had hunted each day to Wally and traded them for walnuts. Herb began accepting *only* walnuts as payment.

They all felt a little bad taking advantage of Wally, but he didn't seem to mind a bit. It was now his job to barter all the products with the villagers. Walnuts had become a **standard of value** for Capland.
