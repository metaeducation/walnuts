![Violence Erupts at the Shirtmaker Strike](images/illustrations/shirtmakers-on-strike.pdf)

The old workers realized it was time to make their move. If they didn't hurry, they would go broke. They gathered together to make plans.

"I say that tomorrow we go to Shirley's , and stop her new workers from getting in," said one worker. "And I'm bringing a club."

"If we can't get what we want, we'll burn Shirley's shop down!" yelled yet another angry worker.

"I think that we should try to convince the villagers that they shouldn't buy any of Shirley's shirts until she has given us what we want," added another.

They stopped at Wallyworth's where they talked to the **customers**, trying to persuade them not to buy Shirley's shirts. Many customers felt sorry for the strikers and agreed to **boycott** her store. Others expressed sympathy for Shirley.

"You should be grateful to Shirley for giving you work," they said. "She not only makes fine shirts, but she provides **employment** for many of us. You have plenty of money to spend which means that we all prosper in the long run."

In the meantime, a **picket line** was forming at Shirley's Shop. While many strikers carried bold signs, others came armed with assorted dangerous-looking clubs. When Shirley's new workers arrived, they faced a solid wall of determined sewers blocking the entrances to the workshop.

Seeing the huge clubs and fearing bodily harm, most of the scabs kept their distance. The strikers taunted the replacement workers and tempers flared.

"You guys have no right stealing our jobs!" yelled one striker.

"What do you mean stealing your jobs? We're justï¿¼here to do work. We need jobs. Walnuts don't grow on trees, you know!!!"

"Actually, they do," snapped Scott. "But that's beside the point. Go find a job somewhere else. You're not going to get one here. And besides, you wouldn't want to work for Shirley anyway--trust us."

Frustrated by the strikers, one brave but stupid scab advanced closer to the picket line. As he approached the line demanding to get through, a picketer with a nasty attitude an an itchy club finger blocked his path.

"How would you like to go to jail for disorderly conduct?" asked the scab defiantly.

"How would YOU like a club sandwich?" replied the striker, promptly delivering a colossal blow to the skull of the scab.

What had begun as a peaceful protest had now deteriorated into a scene of violence and near hysteria. Clubs were flying! The police arrived and restored order; the injured were taken to the clinic for treatment.

The **strike** had already hurt the town economically; this violent turn made matters even worse. Both sides became more determined to hold their ground.

Shirley, of course, was very upset. If she didn't produce shirts, she would lose all of her business to Sheldon, her chief competitor. She hated to see her shop empty and the tools lying around unused.

Shirley had to tell Harry and Harvey that she could buy no more skins until her shop was back in business. She told Tony, the toolmaker, that she couldn't buy any more needles. And she had to tell Bart that she could not repay her loan on time, so the bank had less money to lend.

Soon, everyone in Capland was impacted in one way or another by the strike of the shirtmakers. Yet the strike continued. Although she was losing money every day, Shirley would not talk with her workers.

"I refuse to be bullied!" she declared stubbornly.

Meanwhile, the workers, although living without income, felt that their principles were involved. They would never return to work for Shirley unless she agreed to discuss their grievances and **negotiate** a **settlement**.

The rest of the villagers, who were not so personally involved, thought it was silly that Shirley and her workers would not sit down and settle the problem. So they sent Wally (who was now president of the village business association) to approach Morton, whose wisdom was respected by all of the villagers.

"Morton," said Wally, "we feel that if you talked to Shirley and her workers, you could show them how desirable it would be for them to discuss their problem together. ince people respect you neither side would feel like they were giving in to the other. The workers would have work, Shirley would have profits, and we would have shirts."

"I'm worried that both Shirley and her workers have too much pride to propose a compromise," replied Morton skeptically. "But I'll try to act as a **mediator**, and see if I can bring them together to settle their problems."

Morton succeeded where others had failed, by convincing Shirley and to sit down in a meeting with the workers. But after a few hours, it broke up with no settlement being reached.

So he decided to try a different approach. He talked to the workers separately and learned what their demands were. Then he talked with Shirley to get her side of the story. Based on what he learned, he drew up his own proposal which tried to please both sides, **management** and **labor**.

Now acting as an **arbitrator**, Morton managed to bring about a solution to the problem. Shirley accepted the proposal, although it required an increase in the workers' pay and paid compensation for injury or illness. The workers accepted it even though they still had to work on Saturdays and did not get paid vacation time.

They did learn, however, that uniting had advantages. The workers formed a **labor union**, to help them with future negotiations. Seeing what happened with Shirley and her workers, other labor unions were formed to represent the workers in other trades. This kind of **collective bargaining** became an effective tool in settling labor disputes.

Unfortunately for Sheldon, Shirley was now back in business. Soon Wallyworth's once again had Shirley's shirts back in stock. The hunters were able to sell more animal skins, Tony received more orders for his needles, and Wally could make more loans. Capland had survived yet another economic crisis.
