After all of the arrangements had been made, Ivan hung two signs outside his hut:

|IVAN'S SAVINGS AND LOAN:|
|NEED A LOAN FOR A HUT?  |
|BORROW FROM US!         |

...and...

|IVAN'S SAVINGS AND LOAN:             |
|NOW PAYING 12% INTEREST ON DEPOSITS!!|
|GOVERNMENT INSURED!!                 |

The villagers were skeptical. "Isn't it illegal right now to pay more than 11% interest?" asked Sheldon.

"For ordinary banks, yes," replied Ivan. "But we're a **Savings and Loan Institution** (S&L). A new government approved plan allows us to give higher rates since we only give loans for safe projects like huts."

"Oh," realized Sheldon. "...so if the time comes to pay back the money and I can't repay the loan, you'll take the hut back?"

"Right, those loans to build huts are special, they are called *mortgages*," pitched Ivan. "Also, any money you put in is backed by the government, so you can't lose."

Almost all of the villagers, who wanted to make as much money as they could and who trusted anything supported by the government, withdrew all their money from Bart's Bank. He could no longer make a profit and had to go back working as a part-time bookkeeper for Wally.

Smidley walked past the bank, and when he saw Bart's "Closed" sign, he cackled with glee. He then walked into various stores in the village and came out with large bags, filled with supplies for his slug farm.

"Where did Smidley get all that money from?" Wally asked his cousin, Walter. "I just saw him down at Slug- Mart and he was buying a lot of stuff."

"Didn't you hear? He struck it rich in the Stock Market," replied Walter. "He bought shares in Tony and Nick's companies before they merged."

"That's odd. I didn't know Smidley had any stocks," said Wally.

"He went and bought them just a couple of weeks before the merger was announced," replied Walter. "Not in any other companies, just Tony and Nick's."

"That's pretty strange," observed Wally, "I wonder why Smidley would have bought those stocks."

Sherlock, who was just stopping by Wallyworth's to look at the new spring fashion magnifying glass shipments, broke in. "You know something Wally, I'd bet that the reason Smidley bought those stocks was because of the merger. The stocks in those companies were obviously going to be worth more after the two companies joined."

"But Sherlock, nobody knew about the merger until after Smidley bought the stocks," replied Wally.

"Elementary, my dear Wally," said Sherlock, "Smidley somehow found out about it before the rest of the village knew. Perhaps he overheard a discussion. Or maybe he had a partner who knew Tony or Nick and told him about the merger."

"THAT'S IT!" exclaimed Wally. "I've seen Smidley hanging out with Ivan, who used to work for Tony, but￼started that Savings and Loan after the merger."

Everything was falling into place.

"I'll bet that Smidley gave Ivan the money to start the S&L in return for the inside information," added Walter. "If Smidley is behind the Savings and Loan idea, then everyone who deposited money in it is in trouble."

Wally went to see Ron, and told him what he suspected. At the next meeting of the government, the representatives concluded that Ivan had told Smidley about the merger before the public was told. Immediately, Smidley and Ivan were summoned to the Cap-Hut-Tall where the legislature met. When they got there, the legislators demanded that they collect on all their loans and repay all their depositors.

It turned out, however, that Smidley and Ivan had taken most of the money that had been deposited in their S&L and **embezzled** it for their own purposes. On those few rare instances when they had granted loans, they had given them to people who didn't own property of equivalent value that the S&L could take in the event that the loans weren't paid. Without **collateral**, there was no way to collect on unpaid loans if the money had been spent.

In addition, Ralph said that he had gotten many complaints that Smidley and Ivan had been advertising￼one interest rate and then charging another. Almost instantaneously, you-know-who jumped up and shouted, "Let's throw them in jail!"

"It's hard to point to an existing law that Smidley and Ivan broke," said Ralph. "But as always, we need to make sure this does not happen again. We need to pass a law that orders stores and banks to put accurate lending information on their credit agreements."

"Also, something needs to be done to keep people from buying and selling stocks in a company based on information they hear from someone inside the company," added Rebecca. "That kind of **insider trading** is not fair."

To this the representatives agreed, and a Truth In Lending Law and an Insider Trading Law were passed. The government still faced the problem of what to do about the Savings and Loan.

"We have to repay those people who put their money into the Savings and Loan," stated Ron. "We gave our word that it was insured. And we need to keep the people's faith in the government."

"Smidley and Ivan spent everything that wasn't lost, and we don't have any more money left in the fund. We'll have to take away the money from somewhere else." replied Robert. "What about the money in the **budget** for education?[^education]"

So Smidley and Ivan were forced to give up their Savings and Loan. It took the government many years and many taxpayer dollars to complete the **bail-out**. Bart's Bank went back into business, and although Smidley didn't realize it, he had once again strengthened the rights of the villagers.
