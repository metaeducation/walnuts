Since there was no longer any need to work after supper, the villagers used their extra time to relax. They'd play games or make musical instruments, and discuss new ideas in informal town meetings. At one of these meetings, a young man named Bart made a wild **proposal**.

"Why don't Marvin and Bianca take charge of *all* the farming for the whole village?" he asked. "They have the largest field, and they really enjoy farming. Then Harry and Harvey can devote their time to hunting, because they are without a doubt the best hunters in the valley. Everyone could do what they do best!"

Not many of the villagers paid attention at first, since Bart was something of a practical joker. But the idea was such a revolutionary one that it began to stir a lot of controversy at the meeting. Previously, all cooperation had been done in small groups, but having villagers burdened by so many tasks was **inefficient**.  Village-wide cooperation seemed to offer many advantages.

One man named Wally thought this sounded incredibly boring.

"Marvin and Bianca love to farm, and I know Sean over there enjoys making shoes," he agreed. "But the only thing I seem to be able to do well is grow walnuts. Sure...I like walnuts as much as everyone else does. But I don't really want to spend my *entire life* growing them!"

This was a good point, but Bart's idea still seemed to win out in the long run. Though Wally might end up in his walnut grove for five or six hours each day, at least he could take the rest of his time off and not worry about making shoes and shirts! With some hesitation, Wally agreed that this **division of labor** would benefit everyone.

Soon each villager became a **specialist**, working at only one task. Shirley the shirt maker produced things which you could hold in your hands...which were called **goods**. Others like Herb--who repaired huts--performed a **service**. All the inhabitants of the valley were also **consumers**, taking the goods or services of others in return for the goods or services they themselves produced.

There was only one problem the villagers faced with the new system. That was how to distribute all the goods and services they produced, in order to get what they needed. For example: Herb had to get vegetables, shirts, and shoes. How could he exchange his hut-repair services for what he needed?

The problem was solved by a process of **bargaining**. Marvin and Bianca would offer Herb a bushel of potatoes for having their huts repaired. Herb might feel that his service was more valuable, so he could ask for two dozen tomatoes in addition to the bushel of potatoes. Finally they would work out a **compromise**; Herb would fix their huts for a bushel of potatoes and only one dozen tomatoes.

All the villagers adopted this system, which they called **barter** (in Bart's honor). Everyone produced what they did best, but could still consume the goods and services that they needed from the other villagers. Even Smidley, a shifty-eyed man who lived in a cave on the fringe of the village, finally began trading his mushrooms for goods and services.
