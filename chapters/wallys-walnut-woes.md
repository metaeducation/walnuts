One day, Lucy returned to the village with bad news. The expedition was not doing well and needed more money. None of the Caplanders wanted to buy more shares in it because its future appeared unstable. On the other hand, it was clear that if the expedition did not have more money, all the shares that already existed would become worthless. In desperation, Lucy went to Wally.

"We need money," said Lucy. "If you don't give us any, the whole expedition will end in failure, and everyone's shares will become worthless."

"All my extra money is already invested, and I can't risk the bank's money," Wally said sadly.

"We only need five hundred wood pieces," begged Lucy, "and I am sure we'll be able to repay it very soon."

An idea came to Wally's mind, but he had an uneasy feeling about it. "See me tomorrow. I will have the wood pieces. But don't mention this to anybody."

That evening, Wally frantically cut up five hundred new wood pieces and burned his special mark on them. He had been gradually introducing pieces of wood as the village's **economy** expanded, but never before had he put five hundred wood pieces into **circulation** at once.

The next morning, Lucy arrived at Wallyworths, and he handed her a large sack. "You must repay me as soon as possible," he said anxiously. Gratefully, Lucy promised to do so and left.

Lucy, who had been begging for money the previous day, was now going to all the shops buying supplies. Also, the firewood pile behind Wally's hut had been drastically reduced, and it wasn't even winter yet. These odd events did not go entirely unnoticed in the village.

"I wonder where Lucy got all that money," mused one particularly observant villager named Sherlock, as he casually puffed on his crude pipe.

"I'll bet she got it from Wally," said his stout companion, Watson. "He sure is looking nervous."

"Perhaps..." Sherlock stood up, pipe in hand. "...YES...I believe so!"

"What?! Tell me!" said Watson excitedly.

"Elementary, my dear Watson!" said Sherlock smugly. "Wally made those new wood pieces for Lucy. Ergo[^ergo], they are effectively worthless, since there are no walnuts backing them up. In fact, if *all* of us went to Wallywoths to try and exchange our wood pieces for walnuts, I conclude that some of us would not get our walnuts back."

"We'd better hurry and exchange our wood pieces for the walnuts," said Watson. "That way, we'll have something of real value!"

The word spread, and soon Bart's Bank was swarming with villagers who wanted their wood pieces back. They immediately headed to Wallyworths to exchange their pieces of wood for buckets of walnuts. Before long, Wally had to announce that he had run out of walnuts...even after giving away his own personal supply.

"I am ruined," moaned Wally, slumped over an immense pile of worthless wood pieces.

The villagers, meanwhile, were caught in the middle. Those who had been fortunate enough to cash in their wood pieces for walnuts were happy to have their wealth safe, and could still buy what they needed. Those who had not been able to cash in their wood pieces cashed in before Wally had run out of walnuts shared Wally's feelings. They, too, were ruined.

[^ergo]: Don't bother looking it up.  You'll never use it.
