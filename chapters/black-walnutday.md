![Capland Shops Closed for Business](images/illustrations/shops-closed.pdf)

Despite concerns, it seemed that Capland's economy would **prosper** indefinitely. Businesses continued to produce in large **quantities**, and wages continued to rise as well.

It soon became apparent, however, that all was not well in the village. Shopowners realized that although there were more goods and services available, fewer were being sold than ever before. In their efforts to expand production, they had manufactured more than the villagers wanted, or needed.

At the same time, the Caplanders had reached a point where they could not afford the prices that the shopowners were asking. So even though the villagers saw the shelves overstuffed with Sheldon's shirts at Wallyworth's, they would not buy them.

"We don't need any more shirts," they would say. "Especially not at those prices!"

In order to sell their goods, Sheldon and the other manufacturers tried reducing their prices and held **clearance** sales. When they did, they reduced their profits as well. The village had entered a period of wide-scale economic slowdown. The reduced demand for goods and services was being felt at all levels; a **recession** had hit the valley.

It got so bad that one morning, Sheldon called all of his workers together with some unfortunate news.

"I guess we have **overproduced**," he said sadly, "because there is a surplus of shirts that nobody seems to want. As a result, I've had to charge less to sell all of the shirts we have made. Now, if I don't slow things down here in the shop, I'm going to go **bankrupt**."

The anxious workers looked at each other, as they knew what was coming. Sheldon continued:

"Profits have dropped, and I cannot pay Wally on the loan from the bank unless I cut production costs. I'm afraid this means I'm going to have to let some of you go. I have tried to avoid **layoffs**, but I am no longer able to pay all of you. Those of you who do stay are going to have to accept lower wages. I'm sorry."

At other village shops it was the same story, and an increasing number of workers found themselves without jobs. Producers were either cutting costs, or shutting down their shops completely. Fewer people had money to spend, and this decrease in demand forced prices down even further.

Unemployed villagers began to fill the streets as the economy came to a grinding halt. The village was now in a full-blown **depression**.

Those who had invested money in stocks discovered many of the enterprises they'd invested in were bankrupt or not making a profit. The investors tried to sell their shares, but nobody was interested in buying them, so stock prices also decreased alarmingly. Some investors lost so much of their fortunes that they took desperate leaps out of the windows of their huts[^leap].

Bart also found himself in an undesirable position. No one was interested in borrowing money from his bank to increase production. The supply and demand connection was again governing the economy of the valley, but with a sinister twist.

The government of Capland called another meeting. Villagers listened anxiously, hoping for encouraging words. Ron urged for action, but most of the representatives still held the opinion that this was all part of the **business cycle**, and was not a problem the government could solve.

It was decided that the government would lend money to businesses so that they could continue producing goods and pay off their debts. Yet nothing drastic was done to bring the village out of the depression it was in.

[^leap]: Fortunately, no lives were lost. All of the huts in the valley were only one story tall.
