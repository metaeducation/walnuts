![Pricing of Capland Stocks](images/illustrations/stock-market.pdf)

Many more advances were made in the valley, but progress had its price. The population of the village began to outgrow the valley. The shops and gardens could not provide all the goods that the villagers needed.

Harry and Harvey had become so skilled at hunting that game near Capland became **scarce**. Bianca and Marvin complained that they didn't have enough space to expand their gardens and meet the growing demand for food. Even working **overtime**, enough goods could not be produced.

The villagers became so concerned that they called a town meeting, which everyone but Smidely attended. They decided that the only solution would be to explore and settle new territory, so some of the young villagers decided to make an expedition westward into unknown land. Perhaps, like the boys who had discovered the cattle, they might find a source of wealth.

In order to proceed, the group needed capital. Their leader, Lucy, approached Wally.

"Wally," she said, "when the boys wanted to go over the mountain to bring back cattle, you bought part **ownership** in their venture. They shared their profits with you."

Wally listened as she continued.

"We, too, need money to pay for our expenses. We will explore new territory where there will be unused soil, great forests, and game that has never been hunted. We CAN make a profit, and we will share our wealth with you if you will share our risk."

"How much do you need?" asked Wally.

She began to list the needs of the expedition. After hearing them, Wally shook his head.

"I'm afraid that I don't have that much extra money to venture, and I don't think Bart at the bank could risk losing that amount. I personally can **lend** you a portion of the money you need, and the bank will probably lend some as well. But that still won't be enough."

Lucy looked discouraged.

"Why don't you try asking the other villagers?" suggested Wally. "I'll bet you can finance your expedition through selling **shares** to many different people."

As it turned out, Wally was right. Many of the villagers were eager to see the new venture succeed and to share in its rewards. They, like Wally, risked some of their wealth to finance the expedition. It wasn't long before Lucy had gathered enough money to buy supplies and the journey began.

Those who had invested in the expedition looked upon themselves as owners of the venture, since they had provided the money for it. Of course, many of the villagers shared ownership.

The extent of ownership was determined by the number of shares they had purchased at a hundred wood pieces each. An agreement had been signed that if the venture had made profits at the end of the year, each owner of a share would receive a percentage of the profit, or a **dividend**. The greater the profit of the venture, the more a shareholder would receive.

After a few months, reports from the expedition were especially encouraging, and it was clear that the shareholders would make a small profit in the first year. Many of the villagers who had not invested were now sorry, and were anxious to own a share because they were confident that it would continue to make profits.

Sean, who had not bought a share, went to Wally in order to try and buy his.

"Wally, I will give you a hundred and seven wood pieces for your share in the expedition," he said.

Since he needed some money to invest in Wendy's new restaurant idea, and would make a profit in the sale, Wally sold his share to Sean. Once again the concept of supply and demand seemed to work in his favor. Other shareholders soon began offering their shares for sale, and many villagers were eager to buy them.

Unfortunately the next month brought disastrous news from the expedition. A violent storm had destroyed many of the explorers' huts and had ruined their supplies. Many shareholders, afraid that they would lose money, were anxious to sell their shares. Others felt the new settlement would recover quickly, and seeing a bargain, bought the shares at reduced prices.

The idea of selling shares enabled many of Capland's business people to raise large amounts of money to improve and expand their shops. Wealthy villagers began to accumulate shares, also known as **stocks**, in many different businesses. Shares were being bought and sold regularly, with prices **fluctuating** with the demand for them.

Buying and selling of stocks became a popular way of making money, and some people even lived off the profits from their stocks. Some Caplanders went so far as to hire **brokers** who performed stock transactions for others. They took care of this in return for a fee, called a **commission**.

There were so many people who wanted to buy and sell stocks that a special hut was built on Wallnut Street where a large slate was kept. It listed the prices stockholders were asking for a share, and the price buyers were willing to pay. During the day, this became one of the most crowded huts in the valley, filled with people anxious to be first to make a good trade.
