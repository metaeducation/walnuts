Though Wally was glad there was such a large **market** for his walnuts, he soon had his hands full working in the grove *and* being a full-time barterer! Since he found **trade** more exciting, he decided to let his cousin Walter take over the nut farming. All of his time was now dedicated to being a **merchant**.

Herb built Wally an extremely large hut with extra-secure locks on the doors, where he kept all the hundreds of items he collected. Whenever the Caplanders wanted anything, they could come trade their walnuts for goods at his "Wallyworth's" **warehouse**, located squarely in the middle of the village.

The villagers saved a lot of time by doing most of their trading with Wally, who was affectionately known as the **middle-man**. It had been wasteful for Shirley, when she needed corn, to have to carry shirts over to Marvin and Bianca's distant field to barter. With Wally working in-between them, Shirley would have more time to make shirts and Marvin and Bianca would have more time to spend farming.

Of course, Wally did get **compensation** for his work. When Marvin and Bianca brought in a bushel of corn, he would give them three buckets of walnuts in return. Then, when someone wanted that bushel of corn, Wally asked them for four buckets of walnuts. The increase in walnuts collected by Wally in the transaction was what he called **profit**.

So things were going well overall, but there were a few concerns. One of the villagers named Shannon asked Wally for a favor.

"My hut isn't big enough for all these nuts," she complained. "And I don't like having to watch over my door every day to make sure people don't steal them. Since Wallyworth's is so large and secure, would you mind holding onto my buckets? I'll pay you some walnuts as a **fee** if you do it!"

Ever-mindful to new business proposals that could raise his profits, Wally agreed. He started charging a bucket of walnuts for every twenty that he kept safe. Since many villagers did all their trading with Wally, they agreed to **deposit** their walnuts with him. He kept track of how many buckets each villager had in his warehouse on a piece of paper. Most sales and purchases could be done just by updating the paper...without ever touching a bucket!

Everyone took notice of the ease with which transactions could be performed at Wallyworths. They were especially interested because ever since using walnuts had become standard, a high percentage of the villagers were having severe back pain and needed to see Carlos the chiropractor[^chiropractor]. Carrying around several heavy buckets of walnuts wherever anyone wanted to buy something was cumbersome!

Still, not everyone did their all their trading with Wally. They were used to exchanging buckets of walnuts with each other, whenever it was more convenient or they felt Wally's prices were too high. So they held out from joining his safe-deposit system.

Never wanting to lose a potential customer, Wally tried to think of a solution. That night, he began cutting many small pieces of wood into squares, burning a unique letter W on them with a metal brand. He announced his plan the next day at a town meeting.

"I know some of you have been holding out on joining my safe-deposit system, because you want to trade with each other," said Wally. "So I came up with a solution."

He pulled out one of the Wallywoods from a bag.

"This specially marked piece of wood represents one bucket of walnuts," he declared. "Anyone who participates in my safe-deposit system can ask for one of these wood pieces back instead of a bucket. Itâ€™s an **IOU**, and it can be exchanged at any time for a bucket of walnuts. But you can trade it among yourselves just like it were an actual bucket of walnuts, only it's much easier to carry."

This was great news. Since Wally was a well-known figure whom the villagers could all trust, they began carrying their buckets to Wallyworth's to trade them in. The wood pieces became a **monetary** system, in which something relatively worthless on its own was used to represent something else.

Almost everyone in the valley accepted this new system. Walnuts were still the standard of value, but these special wood pieces had become a **medium of exchange**...despite the fact that they had no **intrinsic value**. Only Smidley, who had never trusted Wally, still bartered his mushrooms.
