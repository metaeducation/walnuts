# Acknowledgment

Although *Wally and the Walnuts* is an original work of a team of very creative and dedicated students, its origins can be directly traced to a manuscript written by William G. Tapply  This manuscript was published in 1969 by the Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs of Tufts University in Medford, Massuchusetts, under the title *How Our Economic System Works*.  This work was our inspiration and provided a take-off point for our "spin-off" book on economics.

We hereby acknolwedge our debt and hope that our book goes even further to interest young people in the real-world excitement that an understanding of economics can bring.

We would like to extend our appreciation to Dr. and Mrs. Ben Dickens for their hospitality as well as their time and expertise, and to Capt. Douglas Cohn (Ret.) for his professional advice and technical assistance.

Special thanks go to Nancy Oliver for her useful advice and support as well as to the Middle School Social Studies Department and eighth grade students at Lake Braddock Seondary Shool, whose suggestions helped our book be the best it could be.

To Brian, Mike, Ian, Racheal, Rohit, and Greg go my heartiest congratulations on an extraordinary effort!  *Wally* is a work to be proud of!
