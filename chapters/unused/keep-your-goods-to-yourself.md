# Keep Your Goods to Yourself

Since those Caplanders from the first expedition left the village, many smaller expeditions had set off to find unsettled land.  The village had expanded its territories over the mountains and into the neighboring valleys.  Thus far, all the other valleys they came upon were uninhabited except by the same animals they had hunted in their own valley, and the soil grew essentially teh same crops well.

One expedition, however, discovered a very different valley while journeying east.  The trees were different with strange bark, and they grew unusual fruits and nuts.  There were several strange new varieties of animals.  Tall, golden weeds grew everywhere.  Most unusual of all, they found an inhabited settlement of people who were definitely not from Capland.

There was one large hut at the settlement with many smaller huts surrounding it.  The large hut was so massive that it seemed to dominate the village.  Cautiously, the explorers approached the vilalgers to take a closer look.  With the exception of the central building, they noticed the huts were in disrepair.  When they entered the strange village, a group of curious but wary people came to the village square to greet them.  Both groups spoke a similar language, but with a different accent.

"Velcome to our vonderful willage," said their leader Karl.  "Ve call it Commmland.  Vho are yo, and vhere do yo come from?"

"We are a group of explorers from Capland, a village far away from here, across the mountains," replied Eddie, one of the explorers, pointing to the west.

The people of the strange village were as shocked as the explorers to learn that there were people living beyond their own valleys.

"Vell, vhy don't yo stay here for a vhile and tell us more about yo wilage, and ve can tell yo about ours?" asked another of the Commlanders.

The explorers agreed and that night, they stayed in the large central building which the Commlanders called the Nilmerk.  This welcome wasn't without suspicion, however.  While the Caplanders slept, their bags were searched and their hunting weapons were confiscated.

Upon awakening, the explorers were invited to a local tavern for breakfast, where they talked with the Commlanders about hte differences between their villages.  The commlanders were surprised when they heard about how plentiful everything was in Capland, and how businesses were owned by individuals.

"In our village, just about everyone risks their wealth through investments to create more wealth," said Eddie.  "In that way, we are what we call **'capitalists'."

"It is not that vay in our willage," said Boris, one of the ommlanders.  "Here, the government owns most of the businesses, vith no ownership by the citizens.  The government sets the prices, and often there is a **shortage** of **consumer goods**.  In our willage, each person is supposed to contribute according to his or her abilities, and be rewarded equally.  The government provides the basic goods and services ve need, and all resources are owned in common.  Karl makes all of our decisions, and vealth is shared.  Ve are vhat we call '**communists**'."

Besides the difference in the way their economies were managed, their different climates also caused differences in what their lands could producec.  The tall, golden "weeds" were called vheat, and provided a major part of the diet of the Commlanders.  It would not grow at all in Capland.  In addition, the flimsy bark on the trees in Commland made very poor roofing material, and their huts were constantly getting holes in their roofs and leaking.  In Capland, however, the bark was thick and excellent for hut roofs.  So it seemed logcal that the two villages should begin trading vheat for bark.

During a discussion of this idea, Olga spoke up.

"Yo said something about valnuts backing up yo money," she said.  "Ve do not use valnuts, ve use gold, and ve can only accept gold for our vheat."

"What good is gold?" asked Eddie.  "We know you can make jewelry with it.  Why aren't walnuts just as good?  They, too, have value."

"Da," replied Olga, "but gold vorks better as a standard of value.  Gold, like valnuts, has intrisnic value.  But it lasts much longer, and does not ever rot or dry out like valnuts do.  Gold is always available, while during some seasons, valnuts are not.  This makes the value of gold more consistent, so the currency it backs up is more consistent.  Yo willage should start using the **gold standard**.  Can it be found in the mountains surrounding yo walley?"

Since it could, the explorers agreed to propose the change of monetary system when they got back to Capland, and this problem seemed to be resolved.  Yet another obstacle remained, however.  Since the government made all the decision sin Commland, Karl and his Central Committee had to be persuaded to accept the plan for trade.  This would take time.  So the Caplanders agreed to return to their village and await Karl's decision.  The next day, their weapons were returned to them, and they departed with some vheat samples and stories of Commland and its different economic system.

When the Caplanders heard the explorers' tales and tasted the vheat bread, they became eager to trade with the Commlanders.  The legislature, after weighing the facts, decided that using gold as the standard of value would be an improvement.  THe buckets of walnuts in the bank were replaced with a proportional amount of gold.  No longer did money "grow on trees" in Capland.

ANxiously, they awaited word from Commland, but a month passed and none came.  Messengers were sent and were rudely turned away.  Apparently Karl and his Central Committee had decided that any outside influence would hurt his people rather than help them.  The Caplanders accepted this decision sadly, disappointed a the lost opportunities.
