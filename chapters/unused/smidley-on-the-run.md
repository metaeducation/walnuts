# Smidley on the Run

Surrounded by all the prosperity in Capland, Smidley and Ivan still refused to get honest jobs.  They couldn't stand the idea of being decent people and working for a living.  However, they were severely limited in the schemes they could carry out in Capland.  There were too many laws protectin gthe Caplanders and a result of their previous scandals.  They saw Napaj, however, as fertile territory for schemes, and decided to try their luck there.  They packed their bags and headed east.

Once they arrived, they immediately began trying out new plans.  Their first scheme, "Uncle Smidley's Microwave Rice," was outlawed because they had failed to inform the Napajese consumers that the microwave hadn't been invented yet, and wouldn't be for some time.  Their second scheme, "Jumbo Sushi," really floundered.  Using an air pump, Smidley and Ivan inflated goldfish to the size of rainbow trout.  They claimed to have raised these fish on a special diet consisting of super protein fish food that would supposedly make fish very large and nutritious.  When reports of exploding fish came to the attention of the Napajese government, one representative cried out, "Holy Mackerel!  Something fishy's going on around here!  Where are these dangerous fish coming from?"

"I think those two newcomers from Capland, Smidley and Ivan, started selling them a couple of weeks ago," replied another representative.

Smidley and Ivan were then called before the legiaslature and asked to defend their actions.  When their explanations were found to eb unsatisfactory, their **swindles** were fully exposed.  THe legislature immediately expelled them from Napaj forever, and they were forced to leave in disgrace with their slugs.

Banished from Napaj, Smidley and Ivan then ventured to Commland.  The word had spread about Smidley and Ivan, and they only managed to carry out one scheme in Commland before they were sent out of the country.  That scheme was "Vheat Thins," where they failed to inform the consumers that the Vheat Thins were so thin they couldn't be seen.

Forced to leave in disgrace with their slugs, they trudged off in search of some territory where the consumers were not so wise, and the laws were not so protective.  Still clinging stubbornly to their dream of creating the world's largest (and only) slug farm, they headed off to the valleys of the north, where although they did not know it, there was a young man being chased into his hut by a wolf...
