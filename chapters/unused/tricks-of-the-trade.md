# Tricks of the Trade

Although their first attempt to deal with foreigners had failed, the Caplanders continued their search to find new markets for their goods.  Many exploratory groups were sent out and most confronted traditional peoples, living in very basic ways, able only tot rade raw materials such as wood.

The largest expeditionary group ever sent went to an area of the far east known as Napaj.  The Napajese people, isolated for centuries from intruders, felt threatened by the large group from Capland and declared war on these explorers as they approached their small valley.  However, the Caplanders, with their sophisticated clubs, soundly overpowered the Napajese, who suffered devastating losses in both lives and property.

Douglas the diplomat sent Mercury the messenger back to Capland to inform them of the recent developments.  The government of Cpaland sent the following message back to Douglas:

"The Napajese will never be able to recover on their own, and it would be to our advantage to develop a strong trading partner.  We think we should rebuild Napaj's economy using Capland as a model."

So Douglas and the other Caplanders began reorganizing the economy of Napaj.  They replaced teh former "rice standard" with the gold standard, taught the Napajese the capitalistic system and began arranging for trade between the two villages.

It didn't take long for Napaj's economy to show signs of revival, as goods and services flowed freely between the two villages.  The Napajese now had many items and luxuries they never had before; their rebuilt homes were stronger with bark from Capland, and their diets were more varied with corn and tomatoes.  In turn, the Caplanders now enjoyed the cheaper fish imports and the rice imports which they were unable to obtain before.  The villagers gladly traded gold for the rice and fish, and the Napajese gladly bought much bark and other goods.  Of course, the price of these goods increased greatly as a result of this new demand.

Before long, the government of Capland noticed a disturbing trend.  It always seemed that the Caplanders spent more for rice and fish than the Napajese did for Capland's goods.  Less and less gold was coming into the bank.  As a result, the Caplander's dollars were backed by less gold.  The government could not maintain the ratio between gold and dollars.  The legislature held another meeting.

"Something has to be done to prevent our money from losing its value again," said Ron.  "I think the problem lies with the gold standard.  We have a limited supply of gold and we cannot continue to drain our gold reserves in this way.  I propose that we ask the Napajese to accept our currency for their goods instead of gold, knowing that our economy is strong enough to be trusted.  We will, in turn, trust their currency in the same way."  After discussion among thesmelves and with the Napajese, Ron's plan was accepted by both sides.

Ron saw one more obstacle, however.  He pointed out to the other legislators from Capland that the **unequal balance of trade** posed a serious threat to Capland's economy.  "There aren't that many thigns that we have here in Capland that the Napajese don't have, and so they aren't buying as much from us as we are from them.  We ened to pass a trade regulation law, and try to get our vilalges shoponwers to sell their products to the Napajese, even if the products are already available in Napaj.  If we sell more than we buy from them, then the wealth of our village will increase."

The idea was greeted enthusiastically by the Caplanders.  So now, when the trading carts went to Napaj, they carried Shirley and Sheldon's shirts, T-N-T's tools, and many other goods which the Napajese bought.

The government of Napaj, of course, was also eager to achieve a **favorable balance of trade**, so it began exchanging other goods as well.  As it happened, they brought excellent shoes to Capland at a price much lower than that charged by Sean and Shannon.  Since Sean and Shannon didn't have the cheap labor that the Napajese had, their production costs were higher.  They had to charge more in order to make a profit.  Without a profit, they would go out of business, so Sean and Shannon went to Ron.

"We can't compete with the Napajese, because they can make shoes at a lower cost than we can," complained Shannon and Sean.  "We have already reduced our prices as much as we can.  We'll soon go out of business.  We have worked hard here in Capland and we employ many workers.  If we go out of business, the whole village will suffer.  Can't the government do something?"

"Well," replied ROn, "we can't forbid the Napajese to bring their shoes here to sell; that would be unfair.  However, I agree that the competition hurts us all.  Perhaps we could charge a small tax on every pair of the **imported** shoes brought to the village.  That will provide the government with additional income, and it will also force the Napajese to charge more if they want to make a profit.  The tax will be high enough to make them charge as much as you do for your shoes.  Then you will be competing fairly, protected by this **tariff**."

The legislature unanimously agreed, and passed the **protective tariff** on shoes.  As the trading continued, tariffs were put on items by both villages.  Soon, each village was **exporting** only what the other needed, and money and goods flowed freely between the villages.
