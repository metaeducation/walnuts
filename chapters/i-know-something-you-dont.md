![Smidley Buys Stocks With a Pile of Cash](images/illustrations/smidley-with-cash.pdf)

Smidley had been even more antisocial than ever after the scandal with his black panther shirts. But his **greed** and ambition had not diminished. He had many ideas for money-making schemes, but knew that the villagers would not trust him because of his damaged reputation. Smidley needed a partner.

He decided to meet with Ivan, a villager who shared his love of slugs and his dislike of the Caplanders. After a￼serious talk, Ivan agreed to help Smidley look for new money making schemes for a share of the profits.

Ivan worked at Tony's Tool Shop. While he worked, Ivan was always listening to conversations hoping to hear something that could be used in a scheme. On a regular basis, he provided Smidley with valuable tips about things going on in the village.

One particular day, Ivan stopped by Smidley's cave with some news. "Today," he said to Smidley, "Nick the knife maker came by too, wanting to know if Tony would be interested in having their two companies **merge**."

"They want to arrange a Monopoly, eh?" remarked Smidley. "That's a good scheme if I do say so myself. But you know the government these days. Join forces and jack up the prices, they get suspicious."

"Actually they aren't planning to raise prices," Ivan said. "Both of their shops needed a furnace for heating metal, and use essentially the same **raw materials** and tools. If they were to merge, they would only have to operate one furnace at half the fuel cost, and would be able to place larger orders for supplies and thus get cheaper rates from the suppliers. This way they would make greater profits, even if they sold the tools for cheaper."

"That's different." Smidley smiled fiendishly. "So no one knows about this yet except for you and me?" he asked.
"Not a person in the village, except Nick and Tony, of course," replied Ivan. "At the end of the month they are going to announce the formation of Tony-Nick-Tools Inc."

"You say they're absolutely sure this T-N-T will be explosive on the market?" asked Smidley.

"They were pretty positive from what I heard," answered Ivan. "Exactly what are you thinking?"

"I'm thinking about how the value of their stocks will go sky high once they announce their little **merger**," said Smidley, twirling his black mustache. "And we have a golden opportunity to buy shares while they're still relatively inexpensive. Then we can sell them at the end of the month and make a killing. Buy low, sell high!"

"That's a good idea..." mused Ivan. "But **insider trading** doesn't seem fair. We have access to information that most people don't have, because I work for Tony."

"Since when do we care about what's fair?" asked Smidley, with an evil look in his eye. "We need to find some money to invest. I could sell all of my mushrooms at bargain prices, and I have some money I've been saving￼for my slug farm. What do you have?"

"All my money is in Bart's Bank, and that's not much," said Ivan. "But we could try to get a loan..."

At this suggestion, Smidley became enraged.

"NEVER!" he shouted. "No Wally, and no Bart. Whatever we can raise on our own will be good enough!"

Smidley began gathering together all his money and everything he owned that he could sell, and left his cave, with a black hat and sunglasses to block out the sunlight. Ivan also went back to his hut to gather what he could.

The next day, Smidley walked into the Stock Market with a large bag. "Give me as many shares of Tony's Tool Shop and Nicks Knifery as eight hundred and thirty dollars can buy," he said with an evil grin.

During the rest of the month, Smidley bought shares of stock whenever he or Ivan managed to get some more money. When Nick and Tony's merger was officially announced at the end of the month, many of the villagers were convinced that shares in the new corporation would be profitable. As Smidley had predicted, he was able to sell the shares at almost double the price he had paid for them.

The two split their profits in secrecy at Smidley's cave the following day.

"I'm going to use my money to buy my slug farm," said Smidley. "That has been my lifelong dream. What are you going to do with your share?"

"I'm going to deposit my money in Bart's Bank," said Ivan, after considering the possibilities for a moment. "That way I can make more money."

Again Smidley was angered.

"NO!" yelled Smidley. "BART WILL PAY! I now have enough money to ruin him. I can set up my own bank in competition with him! I have a plan."

"How can you compete with a bank?" asked Ivan, puzzled. "The government limits the amount of interest to control inflation. All banks are the same."

"Unless you get the government to make an exception, and I know just the way," countered Smidley. "Remember how you said Ron stopped by to get a screwdriver at Tony's shop, and he was talking about how the government is interested in finding a way to promote more hut ownership and less risky investment?"

"Right," said Ivan. "He said they want to influence what people are saving their money for without outright telling them what to do. Or something like that, it was loud in the shop."

"If I could convince the legislature that my bank would only lend money for housing and not risky ventures, they might allow me to pay interest rates higher than the normal bank limit."

A gleam came to Smidley's beady eyes.

"Everyone would deposit money in my bank instead of Bart's. He would go BROKE! And imagine all the possibilities for schemes if I've got access to all the money in the bank! But nobody trusts me. Those fools!"

Feeling dejected, Smidley grew silent.

"What if *I* were to run the bank?" asked Ivan. "The villagers and the legislature have no reason to distrust ME. I could go to the legislature tomorrow and see what they think."

"Excellent!" exclaimed Smidley. "You do that!"

During the following week, the idea was approved. Ivan's bank would be able to pay one percent more interest to depositors than Bart could, and they were only permitted to give low risk loans for mortgages.

To get the villagers to trust the new bank, the government set up a special fund to back all of the money that it lent out. If anything happened to the money in the new bank, the depositors' money could be returned from the fund.
