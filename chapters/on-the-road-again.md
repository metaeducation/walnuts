# On the Road Again

The economic situation continued to worsen, despite the measures taken by the government. The Caplanders clamored for their legislators to help them, and they convened once again. This time, however, the representatives were ready to listen to what Ron had been saying.

"This cannot be avoided any longer," proclaimed Robert. "More shops are closing every day. People are going hungry. They cannot get sufficient clothing, and their huts are falling apart. Let's try Ron's ideas and see if they work. If they don't, then we'll try something else."

Ron took to the floor.

"More money has to get into circulation," he stated. "Then there will be a demand for goods and services. If we can do this then shops will reopen, and there will be available jobs."

"We could make more dollars," Dolores responded, "But wouldn't that be just like what Wally did when he printed the wood pieces to try to save the expedition? We saw how *that* turned out."

"No, printing money is not the answer," said Ron, shaking his head. "But what if we--the government--created jobs? We could hire workers for the new road project, since we need better roads anyway."

The legislators murmured among themselves about this novel idea. Ron continued:

"We would pay these people so they would have some money to spend. Then they would go to the stores and buy goods, so that the shop owners would have money to produce with again. They would then rehire their workers, thus giving them money to spend as well."

"That just might work!" Robert exclaimted. "By the time the roads are finished, we won't have to worry people losing those jobs, because by then there will be a demand for workers elsewhere. I say we try it."

The plan was voted on and approved. Soon, a sign announced the availability of jobs on the road project.

Unemployed villagers flocked to the job openings. The village was ringing with the sounds of shovels and picks, as roads connected every part of Capland. These villagers brought home money which found its way into the stores and shops. The roads also helped ease trade between places that had found it hard to reach each other before.

As the government had predicted, the valley was on its way to **recovery**. It was gradually able to reduce the number of road workers as they moved back to their jobs in the reopening shops of Capland. But they realized they could never again sit idly by and watch the economy collapse.

A special committee was put together to study and advise the legislators about the economy. A careful watch was kept on the unemployment rate, and government projects were started if too many Caplanders lacked work. They monitored prices and wages of essential goods and services and tried to keep them reasonable.

Rather than setting prices for wages or goods, the government decided to limit the interest rates that banks like Bart's could give. If it seemed money was too easy to get and inflation was taking hold, they'd make borrowing harder. If people were spending too much, the government raised taxes. When people were spending too little, it lowered taxes.

Some of the shopowners felt the government was getting in the way, and not letting them make a decent profit. Yet most Caplanders felt safer from these new protections Their jobs were more secure, and their income was more likely to enable them to buy what they needed.

Still, the argument about the government's involvement did not die out. People began to group according to their beliefs about the relationship between the government and the economy. Yet they were proud to live in a democratic society where they could live their lives as they chose.

Smidley, however, sat in his cave all day with his slugs. He was not proud of the villagers at all.
