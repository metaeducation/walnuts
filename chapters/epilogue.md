Thanks to a generation of conscientious citizens, the future of Capland was secure. 

Wally's descendants inherited his capitalistic instincts and faithfully carried on his tradition of economic growth and expansion. In fact, they established a Wallyworth's in every major mall, and thus continued to provide goods and services to consumers everywhere.

Branches of Bart's bank provided sound financial advice and capital to millions of trusting customers.

Marvin and Bianca's descendants were equally successful. The small-scale production of Marvin's Gardens grew into a giant agri-business, so productive that it was capable of supplying markets in neighboring valleys.

After a frustrating career as a legislator, Rick retired and found fulfillment as a prison warden. Putting people in jail and keeping them there consumed the rest of his days.

Even Smidley found surprising success in the north country. His dream of creating the world's only "Slug Farm and Emporium" had finally found an audience. The idea held great appeal to these people who had long been searching for a unique attraction to bring in tourists. Northen women, unaware of the scandals in Smidely's past, were impressed with his no-nonsense business attitude and his vast knowledge of invertebrates.

Caught up in the welcoming spirit of the North Country, Smidley decided to settle down. He succumbed to the flirtations of Helga who became his wife and bore him a son, Smidley Jr., a natural slug lover. Junior ultimately became an equal partner in Smidley & Son, exclusive slug suppliers to the world.

And everyone lived happily ever after.

*(Except the wolves, who were forever bitter about not getting more acclaim for their role in getting all this started. They're demanding that their agent get them a speaking role in their next book--and be featured beyond chapters 1 and 2.)*
