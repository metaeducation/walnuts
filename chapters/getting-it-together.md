![Bianca Builds a New Hut as Marvin Looks On](images/illustrations/marvin-bianca-hut.pdf)

A week later, the wolves returned to Marvin's hut. He was trapped outside without his trusty club. He called for Bianca, but she came too late. Marvin had already been badly bruised and brutally bitten by the time she arrived. As quickly as she could, she helped him return to his hut and bandaged his wounds.

"Hey, Bianca," he said thoughtfully, "living so far apart is dangerous. Wouldn't it be safer if we rebuilt our huts so they would be closer together?"

"Yes," replied Bianca, "but it took me a month to build my hut. We have to take care of our gardens and can't spare the time."

"I'm sure that it wouldn't take very long if we worked together," Marvin reassured her.

So they began construction of the new huts, which were even bigger and stronger than before. In addition to moving closer together, they combined and expanded their gardens across the space in-between them to make one big field. This allowed them to plant certain crops in the areas where they grew best.

Cabbage and corn grew best in Marvin's plot, whereas potatoes grew best in Bianca's plot. Since each section of the field was being used for the crop that grew best there, their vegetables grew larger and were more plentiful. Also, they had room to experiment with radishes and tomatoes, which they hadn't previously dared waste space on.

Of course, the proximity of the huts made life much safer. Whenever a wolf attacked one of them, the other would clobber it. This soon proved to be a safer and more **productive** way of life.

As time passed, the rest of the valley dwellers began to look enviously at Marvin and Bianca's bountiful field. Their corn grew the tallest, their potatoes the largest, and they had the only field that grew tomatoes. Using cooperation, they were able to bring back more than enough game, keep their huts in perfect repair, and still have time left over to sit and talk. They even had enough time to make fashionable hats to wear...just for fun!

It wasn't long before other valley dwellers decided that they, too, wanted to live easier lives. So they rebuilt their huts to form a tightly-knit village near the sparkling river, and began to cooperate in small groups. Each group was able to **produce** more and enjoy more **leisure time** than before.

Those who had joined the village took to making hats like Marvin and Bianca had, to show how well off they were. Soon everyone in the valley wore hats and caps, and they decided to name their new village "Capland".
