![Shirtmakers Present a List of Grievances](images/illustrations/list-of-grievances.pdf)

One hot summer day, a few of the workers in Shirley's Shirtmaking Shop began to grumble.

"We work hard in this **sweatshop**, and Shirley doesn't pay us enough," muttered Scott, one shirt stitcher.

"Yeah, and I don't like working on Saturday afternoons," said another worker named Sally. "I think that Shirley makes us work too many hours, particularly for the wages we make."

"Well, if you ask me, I think we should have at least two weeks of vacation a year with pay," added a third worker, Sam. "I'd like to have some spare time to spend with my family and perhaps travel across the mountains."

"While you're on the subject, I don't think it's fair that Shirley doesn't pay us when we're out sick. I jabbed a needle in my finger and missed three days when it got infected. You'd think that Shirley would have paid me something, especially since I injured myself on the job."

This fourth speaker, Shelly, threw down the shirt she had been working on and turned to the other workers.

"I have an idea," she said. "Since none of us is satisfied with the way Shirley treats us, why don't we ask her to raise our **salary** and add some other **fringe benefits** that we feel we deserve. Let's draw up a list of complaints and requests right now."

So Shirley's workers did just that, and when she walked into her shop that afternoon, she was startled to see all of her workers standing around rather than making shirts.

"What do you think you're doing?" Shirley shouted. "If you don't make shirts how can you expect to make money?" Shelly handed Shirley the list of **grievances**. She read through it quickly and then angrily tore it up.

"If you think that I'm going to do these things, you are sadly mistaken. If you don't like working here, you can leave. Shirt stitchers aren't that hard to find, and there are plenty of them who would be glad to work for me. 

You don't know how lucky you are, having such great jobs."

With this, Shirley turned around and marched out of the room. The workers shrugged and returned to their work, but they were determined not to let Shirley ignore their grievances.

That night, they met secretly at Scott's hut. "Shirley may have been right. She can get other workers to take our places. If she does, then we are out of luck, because she certainly wouldn't give us more benefits if she didn't have to.

Seth, who up to this time had been silent, spoke up.

"I've been thinking," he said. "If we stop working and keep other workers from going into her shop, she will have to give us what we want. I think that we ought to quit and tell Shirley that we won't come back to work until she meets our demands. If she hires more workers, then we can stand outside the shop and prevent them from entering."

"The new workers won't realize how badly Shirley will treat them," grumbled Scott. "Besides, it's not fair for those replacements to have our jobs. They're a lot like **scabs** covering a wound...it's just on the surface, the injury is still there and it still hurts!"

The following day when Shirley walked into her shop, it was empty. She waited and waited, but her workers did not show up. "Their demands won't be met this way," she said firmly.

Shirley then posted a sign outside her shop:

|WORKERS WANTED--APPLY TO SHIRLEY|

Within a few days, all of the job openings were filled and Shirley's Shop again hummed with activity.
