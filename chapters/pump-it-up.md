The villagers had never felt so prosperous. There was a large market for everything, especially toys and games.

Motivated **entrepreneurs** began to increase **production** by hiring more workers, purchasing more materials, and expanding their shops. Although this **expansion** was very expensive, they were confident that they would be able to sell everything they produced, and make profits in the long run.  There were a wide variety of good jobs available, and the **unemployment rate** was very low.

As the demand for workers grew, they were able to￼ask for higher wages. If one employer wouldn't pay them what they asked, they could easily find another business owner who would. Shops began running overtime to produce more goods, and those **employees** who worked extra hours were able to earn even more money.

To finance all this expansion, many people came to Bart for loans. At the same time, more and more Caplanders had extra money to deposit in the bank. "Everyone wants to borrow," Bart said to himself. "If I increase my **rates** on loans a little, they will still want the money and I'll make greater profits. Then I can encourage people to deposit money in the bank by offering a higher interest rate on savings."

Due to this expansion, the **stock market** was also very active. Many people were anxious to get involved in trading shares, since the constantly rising values of stocks almost ensured they would make a profit. Soon, even villagers without much money to invest had a good chance of getting money quickly and easily.

One day a group of women were shopping in Darcy's Dress Shop. "Dresses are a lot more expensive than they used to be," complained Betty. "I remember when I could buy two dresses for what I now pay for one."

"What difference does it make?" asked Darcy. "I have to raise my prices as **production costs** increase. I hired three more employees the other day, and material prices went up as well. You all still seem to want dresses, and you are able to afford them."

"It is true that I am able to buy as much as I could before prices began going up," replied Betty. "However, every time I get a raise, prices go up just as much. I am making much more money but can't buy any more goods."

Though their lives were seemingly not affected, the women in the dress shop felt something was going wrong. But they were not the only people in the village who were concerned.

Many older people in the valley were having a difficult time buying what they needed. All that they had to live on was a **pension**, a fixed sum of money that a retired person received each month. Although prices and wages were constantly increasing, the pension did not, so pensioners were able to purchase less and less as time went on.

Soon, people on pensions and other **fixed incomes** brought their problem before the legislature. "This **inflation** is hurting us," they said. "We have less **purchasing power** as the value of our money decreases. If it is not stopped, we will not be able to make ends meet."

Bart also appealed to the legislature to do something about the rampant inflation. Two years earlier, he had lent Sean five hundred dollars￼at six percent interest. Back then, five hundred dollars could buy many things. But now that Sean had repaid him, the repayment plus thirty dollars bought less than the original five hundred dollars could.

"I keep trying to raise my interest rates, but I can't keep up," Bart complained. "I am being paid back money that is worth less than when I lent it!"

Those who owed money were very pleased with this, but those who lent it out were not.
Many of the legislators were worried as well.

"Even with the great increases in wages, and with almost everyone having jobs, I don't think that our economy is healthy," stated Ramona at a meeting. "Things seem almost out of control. It is as if prices and wages will keep going up forever."

"The dollar is losing its value," lamented Dolores. "How many you need to buy the same amount of goods and services keeps going up. It's very nice that there is expansion and employment, but it's going to come to a dreadful halt sometime soon!"

Rick had never been very good at math. He scratched his head as he tried to think of something to say about the issue.

"Let's... let's throw the pensioners in jail!" he exclaimed. Noticing that everyone was staring at him, he sat down quickly.

"Something does need to be done," stated Ron. "Sure, a lot of people aren't suffering--some people are even better off than before. But Bart doesn't feel that this inflation is fair to **creditors** like him, and others are being hit hard. We can't just sit around and watch it happen."

"But what *could* we do?" challenged Rebecca. "The economy goes up and down naturally. We can't legislate how much employers are allowed to pay their workers, that would be crazy! Through the law of supply and demand, the economy will eventually straighten itself out."

Since most of the representatives found it hard to argue with Rebecca's point, the meeting was adjourned. They did not feel that they--as legislators--should get involved. It was the villagers' right to set prices and wages, and there would certainly be a large amount of resistance if the government tried to intervene.

Yet Ron went away from the meeting feeling uncomfortable. He agreed the government couldn't tell people what to charge. But at the same time, ignoring the inflation seemed to be very dangerous.
