Businesses flourished in the valley; even Smidley decided to accept the new monetary system. Still, his mushroom business was floundering. Although the villagers were extremely fond of mushrooms, they were rarely willing to pay the **extravagant** prices that he demanded. Year after year, Smidley found himself barely keeping his head above water. One evening, Smidley was going for one of his nightly walks through the valley.

"I need money to start our slug farm," he suddenly said to Fang, whom he had brought with him. "Wallyï¿¼refused to lend me what I needed. The fool! We'll get him, Fang. Don't worry about that. But in the meantime, I've got to keep trying."

He was about to continue his walk when he heard two voices coming up behind him. Without a sound, Smidley crept into the bushes next to the road and listened intently.

"You've got to be kidding! A hundred and ten dollars?" said one voice. It was the voice of Betty the bargain hunter.

"Yes, and it's worth every bit of it," said Wendy, the wealthy widow. "They're the new 'in' thing from Shirley's Shop. Let me tell you, my genuine black panther shirt is so durable! And so elegant! Believe me, when I walk down the road in this shirt, people notice."

"Oh my," said Betty wistfully. "I'd sure like to have one of those shirts. But a hundred and ten dollars is way more than I can spare for something as frivolous as a fancy shirt." The voices faded as the two women walked out of sight.

"Yes, Fang," said Smidley to his slug while stroking its slimy back. "That's the latest rage--panther shirts. They look just like normal shirts that have been dyed black, if you ask me." Suddenly, Smidley stood up, almost dropping Fang.

"That's it! How could I have overlooked it!" he exclaimed. "I can do just that! Come on Fang, let's go back to the cave."

So the next day, Smidley went and bought as many of Sheldon's $25 economy-priced shirts as he could. He filled a large pot with black dye #5 and water, and mixed them together over a fire. While boiling the shirts in the blackened water, Smidley began writing up many small **labels**.

The next morning, the villagers saw a sign posted outside Smidley's cave...

|BLACK PANTHER SHIRTS!     |
|OWN THE LATEST IN FASHION!|
|JUST SIXTY DOLLARS EACH!  |

When curious villagers entered Smidley's cave, they saw a large pile of black shirts on the floor. They didn't believe they were really panther shirts until they looked at the labels, which said: "Made from genuine black panther skins!"

"Like, these are so cool! I think I'll like, buy two!" remarked Tiffany the teenage trnedsetter. Soon, all of the shirts were sold; Betty bought five of them. Smidley had amassed a tremendous amount of money in just one day! Without so much as a twinge of guilt, he headed for SlugMart to buy supplies for his slug farm.

Meanwhile, Betty was at the river washing several of her new black panther shirts. To her surprise, the color washed right out of them. It wasn't long before they all looked like ordinary shirts. Angrily, she started for Smidley's cave, followed by many other cheated Caplanders who wanted their money **refunded**.
