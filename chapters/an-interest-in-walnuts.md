# An Interest in Walnuts

![A Moment of Walnut Inspiration](images/illustrations/walnut-inspiration.pdf)

Wally was one of the wealthiest individuals in Capland, and villagers often asked him to invest in their ideas. He could say yes to a few, but since his **funds** were limited, he had to say no most of the time.

This bothered Bart, who was now working at Wallyworths, helping to do the bookkeeping. He'd overheard many of the proposals the villagers made to Wally, and was sad to see how many good ideas were being turned down.

One afternoon he was tallying up the piles of buckets in the **safe-deposit system** of Wallyworth's, when he had an idea.

"Look at all these walnuts being stored and doing nothing," thought Bart. "If the villagers would only trust some of them to me, I'm certain I could pick the winning investments and then pay them for the privilege of using their money."

That night, Bart went home to his house, which was located squarely on the bank of the river. In his cellar, he made several signs which he posted around town:

|WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE AND MAKE A PROFIT?|
|I WILL PAY YOU FOUR PIECES OF WOOD             |
|IF YOU DEPOSIT ONE HUNDRED PIECES FOR A YEAR!  |
|COME SEE BART AT THE BANK!                     |

This seemed too good to be true, and the villagers were extremely curious.

"Do you mean that Bart will pay us money if we store our extra pieces with him?" they asked, not believing their eyes. "Wally used to charge us for his safe-deposit system, but Bart will be keeping our money safe and paying us as well? How is that possible?"

It started to make sense when they saw the other sign that had been posted:

|NEED WALLYWOODS FOR NEW ENTERPRISES?      |
|FOR JUST SIX PIECES OF WOOD               |
|I'LL LEND YOU A HUNDRED PIECES FOR A YEAR!|
|COME SEE BART AT THE BANK!                |

Everyone benefited from Bart's new idea. Those villagers with extra pieces of wood could deposit them safely with Bart and at the same time make a four percent profit. Those who wanted to start new businesses could **borrow** money but had to pay Bart six percent. Bart profited because he made two percent on the money he lent. Since Bart was using wallywoods it wasn't creating problems for the currency system of the village, and Wally gave his blessing to the venture.

Soon everyone was heading to the bank to see Bart, who was now known as a *banker*. He made his profits by charging more wood pieces to the people who he made a **loan** to to than he offered to those whose money he stored. If four wood pieces a year wasn't enough to get people interested, he'd offer more to store their money...and charge more to borrow it. So the villagers called these rates **"interest"**.

Many new businesses were started, adding to the well-being of the community. The standard of living continued to rise. Of course, Bart did not extend **credit** to everyone. Some people asked to borrow money for ventures that he did not think would succeed, which could make them unable to pay back their **debt**.

One such instance was when Smidley came to Bart with an idea for a slug farm. Slugs were Smidley's hobby; he always carried around his sharp-toothed-slug[^slug] named Fang.

"I'm sorry, but I don't think that sounds like a good idea," said Bart. "The people of Capland wouldn't support a slug dealer."

"That's the same thing Wally said about the slug movie production company," shouted Smidley, enraged. "And the slug singing group. This isn't the last you'll hear of me!" Then he ran back to his cave in anger.

Bart occasionally lost an investment. New businesses unexpected failed and shops occasionally burned down. But Bart kept enough money at the bank so that a depositor could **withdraw** his or her money at any time. He reasoned that if people came to the bank to withdraw their money, and were told that there wasn't money available, that they'd be coming for his nuts!!
