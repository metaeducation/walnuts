As the villagers found new and improved ways to perform their services and to produce their goods, they earned more wood pieces. They were earning much more money than they required for just their **basic needs**. The people of the valley also had more spare time, so they developed new **wants**. Caps and hats were no longer the only luxury that they allowed themselves!

Some of the creative villagers began to invent and manufacture games and sell them. The most popular one was the board game conceived by Greg and Gary while walking near Marvin's garden, inspired by Sean and Shannon's successful monopoly of the shoe market. Toys were also produced to meet the demands of the village's children, such as "Walnut Grove Kids" and the "Nutendo" game system.

As their spare time increased, the Caplanders developed even more **efficient** ways of doing their jobs. They invented new tools and simple machines. Their huts were kept in good repair and there was plenty of food and clothing. They had increasingly more money to spend.

While their **standard of living** improved, so did the health of the villagers. Fewer people were getting sick or starving...and **life expectancies** increased as well. These advancements, as well as the increases in **disposable income**, fueled the desire for continued **progress**.

One day, a group of young villagers approached Wally with a proposition.

"We want to make you an offer you can't refuse," said Lou, their leader. "When we were exploring the other side of the mountain, we saw large herds of cattle in the distance. We would like to travel to this land to see if we can capture some of these cattle."

They had Wally's attention--as he always wished he had been a cowboy instead of a walnut farmer.  Lou continued:

"With these cattle we could set up a new **enterprise** and **earn** a lot of money. But we don't have the wood pieces to **finance** such an expedition. If you will provide us with the wood pieces we need, we will share the profits with you."

Wally thought for a minute. He did have enough wealth that he could afford to risk some of it. Here was a possibility that by investing his wealth he would be able to create more, not just for himself, but for these boys and the village, too. Caught up in the progressive spirit of the times, he agreed.

"All right, I'll give you the money you need," said Wally. "If you are successful, I will take one of every three of the cattle you bring back. If you fail, I will have lost my **investment**. I am willing to bet my cap on this, because the possible rewards are worth it!!!"

In this way, Wally acted as a **capitalist**. He was risking his wealth (or **"capital"**), in the hope of creating more wealth. Since they all stood to profit from the **venture**, Wally believed the boys would work hard and use the supplies wisely.

The group Wally had invested in was gone for a long time. His optimism turned to worry that they had either gotten stampeded or had run off with his money. But in a few weeks they returned bringing many fine cattle, and Wally's wise investment had been a success.
