![Smidley Hangs a No Refunds Sign on His Have](images/illustrations/no-refunds.pdf)

Soon the angry mob of villagers converged at the door of Smidley's cave. He was busily setting up his slug farm as he heard their shouts.

"What do they want?" he muttered angrily. Outside, he saw a horde of angry consumers, holding up half-black shirts.

He heard shouts of: "WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK!"," LIKE THESE SHIRTS ARE SOOO BOGUS!", "SMIDLEY IS MOST HEINOUS!", "YOU LIED ABOUT THE SHIRTS!"

With a snicker and a sneer, Smidley pointed to the sign hanging outside his cave:

|NO REFUNDS|

Dodging a barrage of cheap shirts, he retreated to the safety of his cave. The frustrated villagers went to find Ralph, an influential and fair-minded citizen, who always supported the people of the village when they had a problem. They went to his hut and Betty told him what had happened.

"That definitely was not fair," said Ralph sympathetically. "You have been cheated, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you all get your money back."

So Ralph asked for a special meeting of the legislature to be held that evening to be focused on Smidley and his **fraud**.

"We need to throw Smidley in jail!" said Rick, whose solution to every problem so far involved throwing somebody in jail.

"I think we should make Smidley refund everyone's money," suggested Ramona.

"That would be a start," said Ralph. "But we need some way to keep this kind of thing from happening again. Something needs to be done to protect the consumer."

Everyone agreed to this, with the exception of Smidley, who had been forced by the court to attend the meeting. Then another representative, Robert, stood up.

"First of all, we'll need a law to ensure that labels contain accurate information. Special rules are going to have to be enforced in the case of animal products, so that they say what kind of animal it was and where it came from," he said.

"We should also have organizations that test products, provide information to people who think they've been cheated, and bring to court those who use false or deceptive **advertising**," stated Ralph.

So it was decided that Smidley would have to return the villagers' money. He would not have to go to jail, because there hadn't been a law against what he had done at the time he did it. But now, many groups and laws **guaranteed** the villagers consumer rights.

Despite this new consumer protection, Ralph felt the Caplanders still needed a watchdog to expose and prevent **rip-offs**. He formed a special group, known as Ralph's Raiders, which served as the voice for consumers.

While the villagers were celebrating their newly obtained rights, Smidley returned to this cave, determined to find new ways to swindle them.
